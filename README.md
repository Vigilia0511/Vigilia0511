## Work Philosophy

I believe that effective software must be both functional and accessible. My approach to development involves:
- **User-First Design:** Prioritizing the "Human" element in Human-Computer Interaction.
- **Clean Architecture:** Writing maintainable, scalable code that allows for easy iteration.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Constantly refining UI/UX based on testing and user feedback.
